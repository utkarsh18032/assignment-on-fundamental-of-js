// examine the following code.
/* const birthday = '18.04.1982'
const age=somecode(birthday);

we have constant birthday for the date , and also age is constant.the age is calculated from birthday using 
somecode(),means a function call that we didnt explain yet (we will soon) but the details dont matter here , 
the point is that age is calculated somehow based on birthday. */
/* would it be right to use upper case for birthday ? for age ? or even for both ?

const BIRTHDAY='18.04.1982';( make birthday uppercase ?)
const AGE=somecode(BIRTHDAY);( make age uppercase ?)
